show-all-settings

Adds direct links to the various settings tabs to the main board, to the right of the 'settings' link, i.e. the line of links at the top-right of the main board will read:

Settings T C W P A Help Tools

where 'T C W P A' are individually linked to the respective board sections.

This is helpful when setting up boards for new projects that require a lot of configuration.

Improvement: An auto-opening menu (similar to Tools) would be better.
