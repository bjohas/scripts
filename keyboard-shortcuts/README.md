# Keyboard shortcuts

This script adds a number of keyboard shortcuts. The keyboard shortcuts are plain letters (without modifier keys); therefore, they cannot be used while an input box has focus. This is similar to keyboard shortcuts in Gmail. However, the script can easily be adapted to include modifier keys.

The keyboard shortcuts are:
* b to reveal boards dropdown (once the boards dropdown is visible, you can navigate there by hitting tab a fair few times)
* t to reveal the tools menu
* s to navigate to settings
* h to navigate 'home' (all boards)
